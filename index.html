	<p><b>Copyright</b> refers to the legal protection of 
		original works of authorship. This includes 
		literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, 
		and other types of creative expression.</p>
	<details>
		<summary>Copyright Law in the US</summary>
		<p>You enjoy copyright protection immediately at the time 
			of creation but registration with the U.S. Copyright 
			Office allows you to have a civil remedy if someone steals your work.

			There are also additional statutory damages 
			that you can only collect if you register your 
			work and the infringement is especially 
			egregious--like mass distribution that affects 
			your reputation in the marketplace.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Does work for hire have copyright?</summary>
		<p>No. If you draft a website for another entity 
			and the contract grants ownership of its elements 
			 it, you do not enjoy copyright protection and your 
			 client can use the website material however they 
			 wish. Some independent developers maintain copyright ownership in their work, especially if the material involves substantial effort, like original photography, videos or even blog articles.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>But how does it really work?</summary>
		<p>Copyright protection is effective as soon as 
			you post your website. To remind users of this 
			protection, many websites add copyright <span>&copy;</span> notices 
			to the footer.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Is there a recommended way to do it?</summary>
		<p>There is no set template for copyright notices. 
			They are actually not required in the first 
			place--just a long-established habit. Developers 
			use them for reassurance and a reminder to the 
			world that the material is copyrighted rather 
			than as a way to enhance legal rights.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Does this mean that my content 
			is protected internationally?</summary>
			<p>The U.S. Copyright Office is very good at sharing news of international copyright protection treaties and conventions. There are several that go into effect each year and they range from regional to international.

				There are three major treaties and organizations for international copyright protection.
				
				They include:
				<ul>
				<li>Berne Convention</li>
				<li>Universal Copyright Convention</li>
				<li>World Intellectual Property Organization</li>
				</ul>
